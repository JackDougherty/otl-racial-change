# otl-racial-change
Leaflet tabbed polygon map of racial change since 1900 in Hartford County, Connecticut

## work-in-progress
- http://jackdougherty.github.io/otl-racial-change

## To do
- rewrite the existing code (from http://jackdougherty.github.io/otl-home-value/index-frame.html) to add/remove GeoJSON from layer folder for each decade (currently three: 1900, 1910, 1920), since this racial change map had different geographic boundaries (wards, tracts, towns) for each year of census data
